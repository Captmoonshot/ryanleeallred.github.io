The process of compressing data into a smaller form (e.x. a dataset with 40 columns may become only 4 columns)  These new columns are not directly related to the original values of the columns, but instead contain a number representing the rolled up information of the columns reduced.  A good way to visualize this is to think of [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra))
