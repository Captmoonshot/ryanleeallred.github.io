**Pearson's correlation coefficient**

Correlation is covariance that's been standardized by their respective X's and Y's.  Covariace(X, Y) is sum((X - X.mean()) * (Y - Y.mean())) / N.  Dividing the numerator of this formula by the standard deviation will give you the correlation coefficient.  

In simpler terms, it measures how two variables change togeter whether in a positve, negative, or a straight-line direction.

It always takes values between -1 and 1, 1 meaning perfect positive correlation, and -1 meaning perfect negative correlation.
