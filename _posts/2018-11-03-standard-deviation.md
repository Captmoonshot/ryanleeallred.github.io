Standard deviation is a measure of the [variance](https://www.dsglossary.com/v/variance) or spread of your data.  Data with a low standard deviation(as in 'deviation from the mean')has, as you would expect, most point lying near the [mean](https://www.dsglossary.com/m/mean), and a high std or $\sigma$ means a high distribution(more uniform)
