A z-score is used to normalize features with different scales.

Some machine learning techniques require normalization.  For example, Gradient Descent behaves better when features are normalized to get to the solution faster.

To get a z-score from each of the feature values, you can subtract the mean of the feature and divide by it's standard deviation:
\\[z-score = \frac{x_i - \overline{x}{\sigma_x}\\]
