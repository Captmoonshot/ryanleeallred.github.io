- **Data Wranging:** Preparing data data for a specific purpose. Taking data from its raw state and transforming it to another format.
    **Why is it useful?** Raw data can be difficult to analyze and gain insights from. Transforming it into dataframes, rows, columns,                               arrays, etc. to a more userful format allows it to be more easily manipulated and analyzed.
- **Example** The transformed data can be used in Machine Learning to restructure it so it can be used in a learning algorithm.
   - Acquire the Data
   - Data Cleaning
