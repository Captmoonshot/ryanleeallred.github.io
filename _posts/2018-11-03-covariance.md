[Covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance) is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. It is essentially measured as positive, negative, or neutral (i.e. no covariance). If you take two random variables, and the larger numbers of one, tend to corresopond with the larger numbers of the other, then there is a positive covariance. If the opposite holds true, then the covariance would be negative. If there one variable does not correspond at all with the other, you would have no covariance.
