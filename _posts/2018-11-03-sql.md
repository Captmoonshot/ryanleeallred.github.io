SQL is a database type called relational databasing, and is based on ![relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra), producing queries procedurally.  The advantages of this system are its persistence, ability to handle structured data well, and its declarative language, which makes for readable, easily modifiable code.  Its biggest drawback is its somewhat limited ability to scale, but is coming back into vogue in a modern form with [NewSQL](https://www.dsglossary.com/n/NewSQL)
